# Counter: A gentle introduction to LiveView and Tailwind

This is an example applicaton build to test LiveView and Tailwind. The full tutorial can be found at 

https://www.diegofreijo.com/blog/a-gentle-introduction-to-phoenix-liveview-and-tailwind/.

To run this application:

  * Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/diegofreijo/phoenix_liveview_tutorial.git`
  * Enter the directory `cd phoenix_liveview_tutorial`
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * I have not removed the database support from this project even if I'm not using. So you need to create it with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
